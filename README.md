# CraigScrape
Webscraping Craigslist!

This project is still a work in progress, but the ultimate vision is to create a webapp through which users can receive a daily email highlighting all new items that have appeared on their local Craigslist in the last 24 hours in a certain category (such as surfboards or moutain bikes).
